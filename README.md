## About the Project

This is my first portfolio working demo. It includes past work, an educational breakdown of fundamental tech, and a comprehensive outline of my methodology for creating dynamic, responsive websites. I also demonstrate core knowledge of SPA development in a modern framework using only first-party resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Updating node and npm to their latest available version beforehand should ensure everything works fine.

### Installation

First, you'll need to install Vue.js with `npm install -g @vue/cli`. When you're ready, clone the repo and move into it before running `npm install`.

## Built With

This portfolio was built strictly with first-party Vue3 functionality:

- `Vue3` for the development framework
- `Vuex` for UI state management
- Plain `html, css, js` for each component
