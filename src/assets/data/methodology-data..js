    text: 'This begins with an analytical, system-conscious approach. Any arbitrary problem has no solution without some kind of context. Context is the highest level of crucial understanding which comes before the problem can be solved. This involves understanding what I already know, understanding the things I already know that I need to know, and how I will discover what else I need to be aware of. Understanding the relationships between these concepts will guide the first high-level plan for the solution.',

I avoid a trial-and-error approach as often as possible to abide by time constraints. I prefer to repeat the previous steps in increasingly specific scope, gradually deconstructing a problem into its sub-concepts until I arrive at a less open-ended problem sub-domain. This stage requires attention to anything that may reveal solutions that already exist, like an industry standard, a conventional approach, or a past discussion on a similar issue.',

    text: 'So, what’s the key to breaking down a problem-domain into different categorical sub-domains? While inherent curiosity is great for this type of thing, it’s not plausible for a lot of problem-solving dynamics. I might feel optimistically about an overall problem I’m solving, but the solution may require in-depth knowledge on concepts that I don’t have a lot of interest in, and vice versa. I often find the more reliable approach to make this method less laborious is to incorporate creative thinking. Taking smaller problems and observing their different “angles” (problem domain and sub-domain, context, scope, requirements, intended solution) can reveal opportunities for unique and existing solutions alike. This all comes back to refining my understanding of what I already know, what I’m aware I need to know, and how I will discover what else I need to be aware of. This is improved by attempts to think outside the current context.',

    text: 'Finally, we can approach the scenario where both my sheer curiosity and creative-thinking skills do not adequately provide clarity for how to approach the solution. The scientific method is fantastic to this end, as it can implicitly strengthen both former paradigms. This involves defining what’s being tested (a potential solution of arbitrary scope), creating a hypothesis and a prediction (what impact I believe the potential solution will have on the problem), carrying out the method (implement and test) and creating a conclusion (Did this work? What else do I know that I didn’t know before?). At this point, I have enough understanding of the problem domain to test further plausible implementations or seek assistance in a collaborative environment.',
